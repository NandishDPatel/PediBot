# Motivation

We have made this RAG Chatbot for Satya's sister.

Hi, I’m Satya. I come from a family of doctors, especially pediatricians. This app is a small tribute to all the dedicated pediatricians out there—especially my sister.

My sister is currently pursuing her Master’s in Pediatrics and handles numerous cases every day. Sometimes, for complex or critical cases, she needs to refer to textbooks for accurate and reliable information.

Instead of spending time searching through Google or flipping through heavy books, this app helps her quickly fetch relevant information directly from the textbook. It’s designed to save time and provide accurate references in moments that matter.

# Overview

By leveraging advanced retrieval and language modeling techniques, the chatbot provides quick and accurate responses, supporting clinical decision-making with an average response time of under 3 seconds.

# Key Features

Instant Medical Insights: Delivers fast and relevant responses to pediatricians' queries.

Context-Aware Retrieval: Uses state-of-the-art embedding and vector search techniques for accurate information retrieval.

Optimized Performance: Achieves response times under 3 seconds, ensuring efficiency in clinical workflows.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed with a simple and intuitive frontend for seamless interaction.
